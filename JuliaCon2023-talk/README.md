Materials for my JuliaCon 2023 talk:

**"Exploring synthesis of flexible neural machines with Zygote.jl"**

---

Compact neural machines (dataflow matrix machines) approximating a simple algorithm
were synthesized using a novel neural architecture search method
(differentiable programming + training with sparsifying regularization).

Their generalization properties with a tiny training data set turned out to be
remarkably good.
