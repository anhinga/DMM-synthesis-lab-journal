**me**
I would like to resume work on the following project. Please help me think:

**GPT-4**
Of course, I'd be happy to help you think through your project! However, you haven't provided any information about the project itself. If you could please share some details about the project, such as its topic, purpose, and any progress you've already made, I'll be better equipped to help you think it through and provide useful suggestions.

This is the description of what has been already done (it's quite ad hoc): _Here I included the whole jan12-23-talk-proposal.md except for the last paragraph_

**GPT-4**
It's great to see that you've made significant progress in your project so far! Based on your description, I have a few suggestions on how you might continue your work and explore new ideas:

    Improve efficiency and scalability: Investigate methods to optimize the performance of Zygote.jl when working with your neural machines. This might involve exploring ways to make gradient computation more efficient, either by implementing custom adjoints or by developing new techniques for optimizing the computational graph.

    Benchmark against existing methods: Compare the performance of your synthesized neural machines with traditional machine learning frameworks or other state-of-the-art methods in neural architecture search. This will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your approach, as well as provide insights into potential areas of improvement.

    Experiment with different problem domains: Extend your work to other problem domains and datasets to test the versatility and generalizability of your neural architecture search algorithm. This will help you better understand the capabilities of your synthesized neural machines and potentially identify new applications.

    Investigate alternative search algorithms: While you've already proposed a novel algorithm for neural architecture search, you could consider exploring other search algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, or Bayesian optimization, to understand the trade-offs between different approaches and possibly improve the search process.

    Study the properties of synthesized neural machines: Analyze the properties of the neural machines that your algorithm synthesizes, such as their topology, weight distribution, and learning dynamics. This could provide insights into the underlying principles governing the success of your approach and help you refine your algorithm.

    Collaborate with the community: Share your findings and code with the research community, either by publishing a paper or by creating a public repository for your project. This will encourage others to build on your work, provide feedback, and potentially lead to new collaborations.

    Fine-tune the training process: Explore various regularization techniques, learning rate schedules, and optimization algorithms to improve the training process and the performance of the synthesized neural machines. Experimenting with different hyperparameters and training strategies might lead to better generalization and more compact architectures.

By pursuing these suggestions, you can continue to expand your understanding of the capabilities and limitations of your approach, leading to further advancements in your project.
